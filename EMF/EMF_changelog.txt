EMF 2.01 [BETA]
	Province religion conversion now affects religious authority (+1% per province converted, -1% per province led astray-- heresy appearance doesn't count)
	Provinces of different culture, culture_group, religion, or religion_group now cause small local_revolt_risk in addition to their numerous other maluses
	Councillors again lift Fog of War when assigned; multiplayer exploit no longer an issue due to the inability to instantly reassign councillors (now requires min. 14 days)
	Laws:
		Slightly more forgiving vassal opinion modifiers for all Obligations slider increments (+2 opinion)
		Fresh succession law implementation, simpler approach than PB to requirements for passing these laws
		FIX: For a Decentralized HRE or an ERE which hasn't even partially reformed its Themes System, Obligations law sliders cannot be raised
	CKII v2.2 (Charlemagne) Compatibility Patch Continued:
		CKII v2.2.0.1 beta branch support
		FIX: Minor province settlement graphics issue
		FIX: Syntax error in a presently unused trait definition
		FIX: INTER_MUSLIM_WAR_MONTHLY_PIETY_COST = 1 (was accidentally doubled in compatch)


EMF 2.0
	Updated to CKII 2.2 and added support for all of the Charlemagne (CM) DLC content
	[Decadence] As promised, with the advent of CM, decadence has returned! Woe!
	[Decadence] Drunkard trait no longer treated as if it were charitable or diligent trait (vanilla bugs)
	In approval of 2.2's changes, EMF and vanilla now have an identical retinue model
		Cost is a bit higher than previously, although it's very close in nature to the prior EMF model
	AI prisoners will essentially never request better accomodations if you're at war
	Spymaster 'Study Technology' job action now fires less frequently and doesn't scale as well with spymaster intrigue skill
	Crusades now unlock if either the province owner [i]OR his top liege[/i] aren't Christian for Braunschweig, Cologne, Paris, Toulouse, and Provence
	Rulers less likely to declare independence from their religious head if the religion has at least 40% authority
	Research points 'ahead penalty' raised to 40% per level beyond ideal year (previously 30%)
	Children are now only inherently liked by +10 opinion (except when they're a liege) rather than +15 opinion
	While doing a sweep for consistency and completeness for the 2.2 patch:
		The Anti-King Faction should now be prioritized in realms where an antipope is installed
		'Coastal County Republic' CB is now open to Muslims if the defender is also a Muslim
		'Coastal County Republic' CB may now only be used upon provinces that are adjacent or up to 2 sea zones away from the attacker
		'Duchy Adventure' CB toned-down a bit (minor)
		Can no longer ask to join a war being waged with the 'Pagan County Conquest' CB
		When subjugating rulers directly, the 'Tribal Invasion' CB now appropriately applies 'Subjugated' or 'Subjugated by Same Religion' opinion modifiers
		AI behavioral guidelines added to many CBs to improve AI war declaration plausibility
		FIX: Though it should have been released with Rajas of India, one may now wage war with the 'Buddhist Holy War' CB
		FIX: Pressing another's claim now always earns the correct opinion modifier (not de jure claims, which were fine-- personal claims)
		FIX: Claimant faction wars or otherwise pressing a third party's claim on your liege now properly respects the cooldown on [forced] loss of Crown Authority
		FIX: Merchant Republic AIs should now use their CBs more effectively
		FIX: Duke- or higher-tier vassals can choose independence after a successful tribal invasion (yep, decadence invasions are back for now)
		FIX: A number of achievements that were previously not fulfilled when their conditions were met are now properly fulfilled [NOTE: We still don't encourage Ironman]
	Due to a bug that breaks triggered modifiers in patch 2.2:
		The ERE's 'Disorganized' triggered modifier that lasts from 1066-1081 no longer exists (non-critical malus to army morale and morale recovery rate)
		Decentralized HRE and Themes System laws have been refactored as demesne laws rather than crown laws (superior approach, so net win)
	FIX: Weather module would sometimes fail to apply or regionally spread a province modifier for Heavy Rains


EMF 1.03 [final version for CKII 2.1.6]
	(EMF+SWMH) Empire disintegration, for empires not dependent upon Constantinople, kicks in at the same realm size minimum as for the vanilla map (100 holdings)
	FIX: Temporary revolt title dynamic levy laws now properly adjusted for faction size upon third-party claimant faction war declaration and immediately cleaned-up after the war (like all other types of faction revolts)
	FIX: 'De Jure County Claim' CBs for counties already covered by a valid 'De Jure Duchy Claim' CB are no longer listed, as previously intended (minor)
	FIX: Clarified requirements for attacking holy orders w/ SoA enabled for the ERE in third-party de jure claim CBs (minor)
	FIX: Third-party CBs (e.g., pressing someone else's claim) should now properly fulfill the 'Win a War' ambition


EMF 1.02
	Culture technology has been partially reset to vanilla: Noble Customs, Popular Customs, and Religious Customs again grant 2 opinion points per level rather than 1
	Military tweaks:
		RETINUE_FROM_REALMSIZE = 4.0 (-33%, vast majority of retinue cap comes from developing your demesne holdings anyway, so this is minor)
		RETINUE_REINFORCE_RATE = 0.03 (25% slower to reinforce, and this now properly makes them slower to reinforce than levies while at peace)
		COMMAND_MODIFIER_MARTIAL_MULTIPLIER = 0.05 (-33%, return to vanilla, incredibly high martial will no longer stack so strongly with leadership command modifiers)
	Research points 'ahead penalty' raised to 30% per level beyond ideal year (previously only 20%)
	Looting (actually completing sieges while raiding) is now considerably less profitable (raiding itself remains the same):
		LOOT_TAX_MULTIPLIER = 1.0 (-50% base gold derived from tax income of holdings)
		LOOT_BUILDING_MULTIPLIER = 0.015 (-25% extra gold derived from total cost of all buildings in holding)
    New decision: Distribute Newly Acquired Lands. Automatically distribute recently-acquired land, until you're no longer above your demesne limit
		Provinces remain marked 'recently acquired'	for 0.5-1.5 months; it is intended to be used while paused after a war, but pausing is optional.
		All conquests and grants of provinces to you are included in the mechanic.
		It will never distribute counties from your capital duchy, even if recently-acquired.
		Aside from also giving new random counts (1 per province) any baronies that you may have also conquered inside their new county (so that they may, in turn, grant the baronies to the appropriate types of characters-- maximizing opinion bonuses due to grants for all), the process always stops once you're no longer above your demesne limit.
		For every province being considered for auto-distribution, you will be explicitly prompted regarding the province first so that you may easily keep any choice provinces.
		TIP: Manually grant recently-acquired land to dynasty members or favorite vassals before taking the decision to neatly get rid of the rest.
	New CB: 'De Jure Duchy Claim.' Like 'De Jure County Claim' and 'De Jure Barony Claim' but at the duchy level. Usage:
		You must hold the de jure empire or kingdom of the duchy.
		If you're a King and not an Emperor, then you must also have passed either the Internal or Full King's Peace in your primary title.
		The defender must have at least two counties within the duchy (otherwise, 'De Jure County Claim' can be used).
		If it's possible to use this CB instead of multiple 'De Jure County Claim' wars in the same duchy, those 'De Jure County Claim' CBs will no longer be listed.
		In the CB list, these will simply be listed as 'De Jure Claim on <TITLE>', just as it is with 'De Jure County Claim,' so pay attention to the titles involved.
	New mechanic: Automatic Empire Disintegration.
		Any empire that either drops below a certain realm size or, in the case of Byzantium and the Latin Empire, loses control of Constantinople will now automatically be forfeit.
		If the emperor lacks any other empire or kingdom titles at time of forfeiture, EMF will search for an appropriate, de jure kingdom title (one which has no holder and passes the "51% rule" for provinces controlled within the kingdom) and grant it to the emperor. This prevents the Emperor from losing all his duke vassals when the empire title is destroyed.
		For empires unrelated to Constantinople, the realm size threshold for empire disintegration is <150 holdings on the SWMH map and <100 holdings on the vanilla map.
	All children are now inherently more liked by all characters (+15 opinion)-- except for direct vassals, should they be a child ruler
		Ergo, it is now more difficult for players in foreign courts to gather enough plot power to murder entire dynasties without a hitch.
	De jure barony claim CBs now have a truce length of only 2 years (rather than 10)
		No longer will clean-up of a few stray baronies take decades.
	Vast majority of CBs have been modified so that the AI prefers player targets to AI targets, all else being equal.
		If the AI has already determined a player is a valid and worthwhile target (i.e., thinks it might win) and must choose between the player and another equally terrifying, qualifying AI upon which to declare war, it will choose to declare war on the player. This is a rare situation.
		In practice, this will only make things significantly more difficult in the upcoming, optional Hardcore Mode, but the AI could still prove more aggressive against you than previously. Feel the Fear.
	50% increase in intrigue-scaled plot discovery chance when using spymaster's 'Scheme' job action
	Disabled redundant plot discovery via event for 'Scheme' job action and associated assassinations / thugs / mobs killing spymaster
	Councillors no longer lift fog-of-war due to multiplayer exploitation
	Personality trait restrictions removed from player for Become King ambition
	All crown laws now no longer have trait restrictions (succession type, vassal opinions, prestige, and other factors still matter)
	Great Goddess Isis now has sharper teeth
	(Lucky Rulers) Lucky liege levy law bonuses nerfed to 3/5 prior, vassal_opinion nerfed to 3/5 prior
	(EMF+SWMH) The de jure King of Ireland title now destroyed upon scenario startup, making all the Irish minors peers (de jure title still exists)
	FIX: Ambition to lower decadence disabled until Charlemagne
	FIX: (Lucky Rulers) Lucky trait inheritance now works while co-installed with VIET Events
	FIX: Ambition Fulfilled / Fulfilled Marriage Wish / Generous Relative opinions granted by councillor/other ambitions (vanilla bug)


EMF 1.01
	FIX: Imperial Reconquest CB no longer has 'Select valid Casus Belli' issue
	Religious Reconquest CB can now be used on Rum (or anyone that holds Rum) at all
	Holy War, Religious Reconquest, and Special Holy War CBs can now be used on a recently-formed Rum or Crusader State
	Imperial Reconquest CB no longer requires waiting 15 years after Rum forms or after scenario start if Rum is already formed at the scenario start
	Disabled vanilla "trait-shedding" events, which randomly remove a personality trait if you have more than 5 personality traits
	FIX: Pagan religions now correctly require only 30% religious authority to reform instead of 50% (consistent with nerf to controlled holy site bonuses)
	Holy War CB no longer requires any crown authority
	Muslim County Conquest CB, when a religious war, no longer requires any crown authority
	FIX: Muslim County Conquest CB, when a religious war, no longer enforces hidden trait restrictions upon the player
	AI ignores PB's "can't attack allied" restriction against player targets in all claim CBs, to be fair and to add succession crisis / dynastic feud mechanics back into the game
	AI ignores PB's trait restrictions in all CBs when attacking players, to be fair and more risky for the player
	AI ignores PB's de jure holy war restrictions when attacking players, to be fair and more risky for the player
	Reformed Norse may now use the Holy War and Religious Reconquest CBs across sea zones before the year 1100
	(PB/EMF) Tribal Invasion CB for non-Horde cultures now uses the same once-per-lifetime cooldown as the Pagan Subjugation CB (usage of the former will prevent the latter)


EMF 1.0
	Dynamic levies: For all rulers, liege levy-raising efficiency scales down with increasing realm size, the number of holdings in the ruler's (sub-)realm, on a very finely-grained nonlinear curve.
		This curve effectively balances large, decentralized realms; it relatively boosts smaller, more centralized realms; and yet it still ensures reliable and reasonable returns upon army size from conquest at every level.
		Players will note that total army sizes for large, decentralized realms are much smaller than they'd normally expect.
		Since all troop counts have been taken down a notch and the difference between larger and smaller realms (or vassals and lieges) significantly reduced, the world is alive with a much more dynamic AI when it comes to war.
		Players can see their current levy efficiency by scrolling down to the bottom of the Laws screen, where they will find a Levy Efficiency law, its associated percentage, and its effects in a tooltip.
		More information on the curve itself (which differs slightly between SWMH and vanilla maps) and its properties will be made public at a later date.
		NOTE: Currently, there might be a _cosmetic_ bug wherein it appears more than one dynlevy (dynamic levy) law is applied at once. In truth, only one of them is active, and it'll be automatically fixed when you change realm_size tiers (5-6 holdings/tier, so frequently). We've only seen this once, and it may have already been solved, but should players run into it, we've provided a debug event to cleanup the Laws view:
			Open up the console and invoke: event emf_dynlevy.24
	When a liege raises his liege levy, only half of the troops in a given vassal's subrealm are raised (vanilla-- in PB, it's 100%)
	PB-style demesne law sliders (Focus and Obligations) have been rewritten to provide different, easier to analyze effects that better complement the new liege levy system and make far more combinations realistically valid strategic choices.
		All vassal classes (castle, city, temple) contribute equal liege levy percentage changes for each law.  Ergo, liege levy army composition is far more balanced than previously.
		A player with a larger realm will find far more benefit than previously in increasing vassal obligations or, potentially, focusing upon levies rather than taxes, due to the countervailing effects of dynamic levies.
	Weather system that considers terrain, season, and other factors is constantly running in the background, serving its meteorologic might upon clusters of provinces throughout the world. If a province is so included in a regional anomaly, it will experience major effects upon levy sizes, taxes, local army movement speed, and more.
		Look for snazzy new weather-related province modifier icons when selecting a province on the map.
		Though effects are short-lived (seasonal), beware modifiers affecting movement speed during tactical campaigns, and take advantage of enemy levy size weaknesses.
	Smart Tactics System. Combat tactics have been completely overhauled for more realistic combat tactics, outcomes, cultural command differences, and overall balance.
		Tactics as a whole have been standardized to prevent certain compositions from excelling beyond the norm. For example, English Massive Longbow Volley is now only as powerful as the other cultural tactics.
		Every culture has a cultural tactic now, instead of just a few. These cultural tactics are designed to match their unique retinue or cultural building, so that those compositions will excel.
		No longer will having a few stray units of a different type cause their tactic to pop up. Now having a large group of a single unit will completely force out irrelevant tactics.
		Taking a page from Better Army's and ClearCombat's books, every tactic has Good/Neutral/Bad variations. Even a Bad tactic is better than no tactic, but better commanders will use better tactics and be more effective overall.
		By bringing the bonuses from particular tactics in line with those from technology, terrain, cultural differences, and leadership, the player gets more of what they expect from combat without dumbing-down any of the relevant factors.
	All mercenary companies' compositions completely rebalanced to synergize with the cultural tactics relevant to their origin and generally be more effective with regard to Smart Tactics.
	Independence Factions are now far more rowdy.
	2 new Muslim holy orders: 1 Shia (the Saqaliba), and 1 Sunni (the Arsiyah).
	Rebalanced holy order compositions and sizes to fit better in a dynamic levies world (fewer troops) and generally provide no implausible, runaway advantage to Christians, Muslims, or reformed pagans.
	Norse females may lead Norse troops (and serve as marshals). All hail Shield-Maiden Lagertha!
	Updated retinue model. Retinues cost more while reinforcing, and their reinforce rate is as slow as the levy reinforce rate. They have a smaller constant cost.
	Decentralized HRE and Themes System modifiers changed.
	Wars are more unpredictable, generally not decided by single battles, and take longer while allies are far more relevant.
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Lucky Rulers: Assigns a collection of rulers a special, inherited Lucky Ruler trait that ensures they will be interesting to watch and/or rival.
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Resurrected 'Random Rulers,' which applies a new set of random yet coherent traits (incl. all extended traits) to startup rulers and their families (credit to MFCamillus for finding the source of the crash in the old version and adding diplomat trait distribution).
	[Scenario Customization Decision] Vanilla Crusades: players may choose to use the vanilla Crusade mechanic (updated in CKII 2.0) rather than PB's different, custom mechanic.
	Until Charlemagne's promised overhaul of decadence, decadence's positive and negative effects have been completely removed.
		Decadence events, tribal invasions, faction effects, and Decadent trait distribution also disabled.
		Players can simply disregard whatever decadence value their dynasty has, although it should rarely change.
	[Ambition] Pledge Peace for 15 Years (can be repeated)
		Garners immediate vassal opinion and a defensive liege levy boost so long as the pledge is not broken.
		You will be punished if you break the pledge, although it's not particularly easy to accidentally do so (CBs, e.g., will be greyed-out).
		Significant bonuses upon completion.
	[Ambition] Win a War (can be repeated)
	[Ambition] Win a Holy War (can be repeated)
		For both of these ambitions, winning a defensive war also counts, all religious wars count for the latter-- not just Holy War, and all types of war count for the former.
	[Ambition] Find a Hobby
		Increases chances of gaining a lifestyle trait
	Tons of improvements to PB and/or vanilla to reduce event spam/incoherency/immersion-breaking while improving plausibility. Notable examples:
		Doubled the base MTTH for title and marriage begging events.
		Overhauled lifestyle events to be more varied and no longer have wildly differing MTTHs.
		Can no longer gain Craven in battle by totally random event. Likewise, gaining Brave is considerably more rare.
		Holy order recruitment now ignores married characters (unless they're without young children) and whether the holy order was "expelled" from the realm.
		Characters will no longer beg for titles while they're commanding troops during war.
		Characters captured via a siege will now defer any request for mercy for 1 year, after which a 50% longer MTTH applies to mercy requests.
	Tweaks to many vanilla traits for piety gain, lower vassal_opinion impacts, more advantages to previously "bad" traits like Content, etc.
	Republics have been notably de-nerfed-- as part of your realm, while watching them, and while playing as one.
	Chancellor can fabricate claims on duchies with lower diplomacy (as little as 12). Encourages less unlanding of original characters, although it is still unlikely.
	Fabrication of claims is now faster for these cases:
		Faster in capital duchy
		Faster if directly bordering _demesne_ province(s)
	Altered skill curve for councillors that also happens to support job efficacy gains at all skill levels up to and including 30.
	Free Investiture is now more attractive:
		It grants +8 opinion from vassals with bishops and +20 opinion from bishops to their direct lieges.
		Bishops now only inherently like the Pope with +15 opinion rather than +20.
	Royal marriage alliances ("Marriage Ties") yield +40 opinion rather than +30 opinion. Consider marrying your daughters to vassals.
	Lieges no longer inherently dislike faction members, and vassals may join 1 more faction than previously (everybody's in the Autonomy Faction).
	Combat trait advancement (with and without corresponding ambitions selected) is now much more likely from leading troops or winning duels.
	Combat trait advancement ambitions are now half as likely to be selected by the AI.
	Heresy spread should now be more gradual until a religion's authority truly plummets, at which point heresy takeover is more likely.
	Crusades/Jihads can be called with a 40% religious authority minimum, rather than 50%. Other changes to Crusade requirements to more closely follow vanilla.
	Catholic 'Request for Invasion' now more likely to be successful and requires only 40% religious authority, rather than 50%
	Catholic 'Ask for Claim' now more likely to be successful and costs only 50 piety instead of 100
	Serious piety boost for building new temples (i.e., granting them to a bishop), especially count-tier temples
	Minimum amount of de jure territory required to form or usurp an empire dropped to 2/3
	Secondary spouses are now significantly less fertile
	Marriage defines tweaked to deemphasize pro-blobbing unions at the risk of more strange unions (only axis of moddability)
	Takes advantage of the new static modifiers for age groups which were added in CKII 2.1 for modders and no longer uses the "old age" event.
		Ages 0-15:  health -0.5
		Ages 16-19: health +0.5, fertility +5%, sex_appeal_opinion +5, liege_opinion -10 (opinion of liege)
		Ages 20-29: health +0.5, fertility +10%, sex_appeal_opinion +5
		Ages 50-59: health -1.0, fertility -10%, sex_appeal_opinion -5
		Ages 60-99: health -2.0, fertility -15%, sex_appeal_opinion -10
	Councillors may be immediately reassigned.
	Players need only wait 1 year after activation to be able to cancel their ambition.
	De jure territory bonuses/penalties to levies have been significantly "flattened." Closer to a pre-CKII-2.0 setup than previously, it simplifies matters significantly with regard to dynamic levies, and promotes centralization (strong demesne, keeping vassals balkanized, etc.), as it applies to every ruler's capital:
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1.25
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_LEVY_MULT = 1.5
		CAPITAL_COUNTY_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_LEVY_MULT = 1.25
		CAPITAL_DUCHY_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.9
		CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.8
		OUTSIDE_LEVY_MULT = 1
		OUTSIDE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.7
	Countless tweaks to PB/vanilla defines and modifiers, significantly changing gameplay behavior.
	An excess of changes that were made to both PB and EMF over the last couple months that need not be duplicated in this log.
